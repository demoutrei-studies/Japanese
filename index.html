        <span class="title">Japanese Writing</span>
        <p>The Japanese language's writing system consists of three character types called: <b>Hiragana</b>, <b>Katakana</b>, and <b>Kanji</b>. Each type has a different purpose. Hiragana is used for native Japanese function words, Katakana is used for borrowed words from other languages, and Kanji are Chinese origin characters that have been adapted to the Japanese language.</p>

        <span class="title">Hiragana &lpar;ひらがな&rpar;</span>
        <p>
          Hiragana is a phonetic writing system, which means that each character represents one character syllable. It was first developed in the 5th century and is still used today to write Japanese words. Hiragana is also used to write words that are not easily spelt using Kanji or Katakana.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are a few examples of how Hiragana is used:
          <ul>
            <li>にほん &lpar;Nihon&rpar; - Japan</li>
            <li>ごがく &lpar;gogaku&rpar; - linguistics</li>
            <li>あした &lpar;Ashita&rpar; - tomorrow</li>
            <li>きもち &lpar;Kimochi&rpar; - feelings</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are some sample phrases that are written in Hiragana:
          <ul>
            <li>はじめまして &lpar;Hajimemashite&rpar; - Nice to meet you.</li>
            <li>ぼくはにほんじんです &lpar;Boku wa nihonjin desu&rpar; - I am Japanese.</li>
            <li>きょうは なんにちですか &lpar;Kyoo wa nannichi desu ka&rpar; - What is the date today?</li>
            <li>あいしてる &lpar;Aishiteru&rpar; - I love you.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </section>

        <span class="title">Katakana &lpar;カタカナ&rpar;</span>
        <p>
          Katakana was first developed in the 9th century and is used mainly to write borrowed words from other foreign languages. Just like Hiragana, Katakana has a phonetic value, and each character represents one syllable. It is written in the same way and has the same sounds as Hiragana, with each character representing a sound.
        </p>
        <p>
          Katakana was created to allow the Japanese to write words borrowed from other foreign languages more easily. Since Kanji was not suitable for representing non-Chinese loanwords, Katakana was developed as a phonetic alphabet specifically for this purpose. It was modelled after the Hiragana writing style, and at first, both were used together.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are a few examples of how Katakana is used:
          <ul>
            <li>アメリカ &lpar;Amerika&rpar; - America</li>
            <li>ビール &lpar;biiru&rpar; - beer</li>
            <li>サッカー &lpar;sakkaa&rpar; - soccer</li>
            <li>キャンディ &lpar;kyandi&rpar; - candy</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are some sample conversational phrases that are written in Katakana:
          <ul>
            <li>ビールを飲む &lpar;Biiru o nomu&rpar; - To drink beer</li>
            <li>サッカーを見る &lpar;Sakkaa o miru&rpar; - To watch soccer</li>
            <li>キャンディがすきです &lpar;Kyandi ga suki desu&rpar; - I like candy</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <span class="title">Kanji &lpar;漢字&rpar;</span>
        <p>
          Kanji is the oldest and most complex of the three writing systems in Japanese. It is a logographic writing format which means that each cahracter represents one word. This kind of written form called Kanji has developed in China over 2,000 years ago and was brought to Japan by Buddhist missionaries in the 5th century.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kanji is written in the same way as Hiragana and Katakana, with each character representing a sound. However, it can be quite complicated to write and requires a lot of practice.

        <span class="title">Importance in Society</span>
        <p>
          The Japanese writing system is crucial for society by enabling nuanced communication, disambiguating homophones, conveying cultural identity, and allowing for literary depth; with Kanji providing meaning, Hiragana handling grammar/native words, and Katakana marking foreign terms, all blending for efficient, rich expression in daily life, education, and media. This unique combination allows complex ideas to be expressed concisely, preserving cultural heritage while adapting to modern needs.
